# Trac Support



Like in most [
open source projects](http://www.opensource.org/), Trac support is available primarily through the [
mailing list](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/MailingList) and the [
project wiki](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/). Both are maintained by the trac community. The [
project wiki](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/) is the authoritative source for the [TracGuide](trac-guide), consisting of the administrator and user guides for Trac.



There is an [
IRC channel](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/IrcChannel) where online users can help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.



You can search questions tagged with `trac` on \[SO:tagged/trac Stack Overflow\].



Before you start a new support query, make sure you have done the appropriate searching:


- in the project's [ FAQ](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/TracFaq)
- in past messages to the [
  Trac Users Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/trac-users)
- in the Trac ticket system, using either a [
  full search](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/search%3A%3Fq%3D%26ticket%3Don%26wiki%3Don) or a [
  ticket query](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/query%3A).


Please **don't** create a ticket in trac.egdewall.org to ask a Trac support question. Only use it when you face a *real* and *new* bug in Trac, and do so only after having read the [
NewTicketGuidelines](http://trac.edgewall.org/intertrac/NewTicketGuidelines). The more a bug report or enhancement request complies with those guidelines, the higher the chances are that it will be fixed or implemented promptly!

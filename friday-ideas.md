# How Should We Spend Friday?


## Projects



Moved most of the "focused" projects to [HackathonProjects](hackathon-projects). 
Add projects ideas there, and add your name if you're interested in working on them.


- Discussing proposed changes to backend and code generation
- Discussing dynamic linking
- Strategies in debugging GHC and RTS.

## General Organization



The above are specific projects or subgroups that might form.  What about more generally?  How should we organise the day?


- just let everyone hack on individual projects, with floating Simons to help. --- I'd like that.
- form subgroups to work together on shared projects (list moved to [HackathonProjects](hackathon-projects))
- have more explanatory talk sessions led from the front
- form subgroups for explanatory sessions on different topics (but not to work on a shared project)
- work on fleshing out the wiki/commentary?
- ???

# `RdrNames`, `Modules`, and `OccNames`



When the parser parses an identifier, it generates a `RdrName`.  A `RdrName` is pretty much just a string, or a pair of strings, for a qualified name, such as `M.x`.  Here's the data type declaration, from [compiler/basicTypes/RdrName.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/basicTypes/RdrName.hs):


```wiki
data RdrName 
  = Unqual OccName
	-- Used for ordinary, unqualified occurrences 

  | Qual ModuleName OccName
	-- A qualified name written by the user in 
	--  *source* code.  The module isn't necessarily 
	-- the module where the thing is defined; 
	-- just the one from which it is imported

  | Orig Module OccName
	-- An original name; the module is the *defining* module.
	-- This is used when GHC generates code that will be fed
	-- into the renamer (e.g. from deriving clauses), but where
	-- we want to say "Use Prelude.map dammit".  
 
  | Exact Name
	-- We know exactly the Name. This is used 
	--  (a) when the parser parses built-in syntax like "[]" 
	--	and "(,)", but wants a RdrName from it
	--  (b) by Template Haskell, when TH has generated a unique name
```


User-written code never gets translated into the last two alternatives.  They are used only internally by the compiler.
For example, code generated by `deriving` might use an `Orig` to refer to `Prelude.map`, ignoring whatever `map` might happen to be in scope (dammit).


## The `Module` and `ModuleName` types



In GHC, a *module* is uniquely defined by a pair of the module name and the package where the module is defined.  The details are in [compiler/basicTypes/Module.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/basicTypes/Module.hs) and  [compiler/main/PackageConfig.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/main/PackageConfig.hs), but here are the key definitions:


```wiki
newtype PackageId = PId FastString

newtype ModuleName = ModuleName FastString

data Module = Module {
   modulePackageId :: !PackageId,  -- pkg-1.0
   moduleName      :: !ModuleName  -- A.B.C  }
```


You'll notice that a `Qual` `RdrName` contains a `ModuleName`; which module is referred to depends on the import declarations in that module.  In contrast, a `Orig` `RdrName` refers to a unique `Module`.


## The `OccName` type



An `OccName` is more-or-less just a string, like "foo" or "Tree", giving the (unqualified) name of an entity. 
Well, not quite just a string, because in Haskell a name like "C" could mean a type constructor or data constructor, depending on context. So GHC defines a type `OccName` that is a pair of a `FastString` and a `NameSpace` indicating which name space the name is drawn from. The data type is defined (abstractly) in [compiler/basicTypes/OccName.hs](/trac/ghc/browser/ghc/compiler/basicTypes/OccName.hs):


```wiki
data OccName = OccName 
    { occNameSpace  :: !NameSpace
    , occNameFS     :: !FastString
    }
```


The name spaces are: 


```wiki
data NameSpace = VarName	-- Variables, including "source" data constructors
	       | DataName	-- "Real" data constructors 
	       | TvName		-- Type variables
	       | TcClsName	-- Type constructors and classes; Haskell has them
				-- in the same name space for now.
```


Attaching the names to their name spaces makes it very convenient to build mappings from names to things; where such a mapping might contain two strings that are identical, they can be distinguished by the name space, so when mapping `OccName`s, a single map suffices.

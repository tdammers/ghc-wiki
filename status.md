# GHC Status



This page summarises the state of play on GHC


## Releases



Here are our [release](working-conventions/releases) plans for


- [GHC 8.8.1](status/gh-c-8.8.1) (next major release)

## Automated builds and performance testing



We keep notes on compiler performance


- [Performance/Runtime](performance/runtime) for issues pertaining to the performance of code generated by GHC.
- [Performance/Compiler](performance/compiler) for issues pertaining to the performance of GHC itself.


We have several automated ways of monitoring GHC.  Each has its own detailed description page.


- [Harbormaster](phabricator/harbormaster) is a part of [Phabricator](phabricator), which builds all [
  GHC commits](https://phabricator.haskell.org/diffusion/GHC/history/) and incoming patches for testing.
- [The GHC builders](builder-summary) build GHC every night on multiple platforms.
- [Travis](travis) also watches the repository for new commits (any branch) and validates them. [](https://travis-ci.org/ghc/ghc/builds)
- [
  Our performance dashboard](http://perf.haskell.org/ghc) monitors changes in the performance of GHC itself, and of programs compiled by GHC, with a per-commit granularity.
- [ Haskell.org server status page](http://status.haskell.org/)

## Components



Template Haskell has its own status page at [TemplateHaskell/Status](template-haskell/status).


## Tickets and patches


- [Summary of open tickets](status/tickets), listed by component.
- [Ticket statistics](status/ticket-stats): the number of tickets created in a certain year, and their current status.
- [Status/SLPJ-Tickets](status/slp-j--tickets) is a curation of interesting tickets by SPJ
- The [GHC bug sweep](bug-sweep) attends to lost and forgotten tickets.

- [

- [
  A list of all Phabricator patches that have been accepted](https://phabricator.haskell.org/differential/query/5LIb9B9n_08b/)


GHC's Trac is also used by the [
Haskell Core Libraries Committee](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Core_Libraries_Committee) to track progress on changes to the [
core libraries](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Library_submissions#The_Core_Libraries):


- [
  Active Core Libraries tickets](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=infoneeded&status=merge&status=new&status=patch&status=upstream&component=Core+Libraries&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority) (these tickets have "Component" set to "Core Libraries")

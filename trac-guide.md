# The Trac User and Administration Guide





*The [TracGuide](trac-guide) is meant to serve as a starting point for all documentation regarding Trac usage and development. The guide is a free document, a collaborative effort, and a part of the [
Trac Project](http://trac.edgewall.org) itself.*

## Introduction



Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project management. It helps developers write great software while staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a team's established development process and policies.



It provides an interface to Subversion as well as other version control systems, an integrated Wiki and convenient reporting facilities.



Trac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, creating links and seamless references between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki pages. A timeline shows all current and past project events in order, making the acquisition of an overview of the project and tracking progress very easy. The roadmap shows the road ahead, listing the upcoming milestones.

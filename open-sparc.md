This is the main page for the Haskell/OpenSPARC project.


## About the project



It is a joint project between Sun Microsystems and the Haskell.org community. Ben Lippmeier will spend three months hacking on GHC to make it perform well on the latest multi-core OpenSPARC chips. Sun has provided the funding for Ben to work on this full time and has donated a powerful SPARC server for him and the rest of us to use.



Ben is working with Roman Leshchinskiy as a mentor and Darryl Gove as an adviser. ﻿Roman works on Data Parallel Haskell at UNSW and ﻿Darryl is a senior staff engineer in the SPARC compiler team at Sun.

# SIMD instructions in GHC



The goal of the SIMD project is to allow GHC and Haskell libraries to take advantage of SIMD vector instructions. Please see more information on


- [design](simd/design)
- [implementation status](simd/implementation/status)

## Obsolete sub-topics


- An [implementation plan](simd/implementation/plan).
- Manuel's notes on [implementing SIMD support in GHC using LLVM](simd/implementation/llvm).
- An [old implementation](simd/implementation/old) of the very beginnings of SIMD support in GHC.
- An example of vector operations in [LLVM IL](simd/llvm-example).

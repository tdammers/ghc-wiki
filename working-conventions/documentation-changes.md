# How to change GHC's documentation



Updating [
GHC's documentation](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/) is easy, and can benefit new comers greatly !



GHC's documentation is included within in its source code, using [
Haddock's markup](http://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markup.html).



Here are the steps to modify it:


1. **Create a [
  Pull Request](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr)** on [
  GitHub](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/). 

1. **Wait** for the reviewers to look at your patches. If this takes more than a week, complain! 

1. **Wait** for bgamari to publish the documentation. (As of Nov 2017, he runs the publish script manually, about once a month.)  If this takes more than a month, complain on the `#ghc` channel on [
  FreeNode](http://freenode.net/) !  


Loathe github? You can update documentation using [Phabricator](phabricator) too!



Then have a beer on us.  We are truly grateful.

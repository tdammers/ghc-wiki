# Mailing lists and IRC



GHC developers hang out on the [
ghc-devs mailing list](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-devs).



There is also [
ghc-tickets](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-tickets), which receives a copy of traffic from the bug tracker, and [
ghc-commits](http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/ghc-commits), which receives a copy of all commit messages.



The traffic levels vary quite a bit depending on how much activity there is.


## IRC



GHC developers also hang out on `#ghc` channel on [
FreeNode](http://freenode.net/). This is a good place to ask questions related to working on GHC itself; if you have more general questions then `#haskell` is probably more appropriate.



Chatlogs can be found at [
http://ircbrowse.net/browse/ghc](http://ircbrowse.net/browse/ghc).

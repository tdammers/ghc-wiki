# Proposing changes in GHC



As of December 2016 GHC has a semi-formal process for considering user-facing changes to the compiler and its core libraries (specifically those falling outside of the purview of the [
Core Libraries Committee](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Core_Libraries_Committee). The proposals are tracked in the `ghc-proposals` [
Github repository](http://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals). See the [
readme](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/README.rst) for details.

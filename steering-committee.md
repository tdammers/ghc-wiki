# The GHC Steering Committee



The goal of the committee is to facilitate the process of proposing changes to GHC by contributors, and to decide on which proposals are adopted.  The committee will ensure that decisions are taken in a timely manner, and after considering the diverse needs of all GHC users.



For current and accepted proposals, processes, list of members and more details, please see the [
